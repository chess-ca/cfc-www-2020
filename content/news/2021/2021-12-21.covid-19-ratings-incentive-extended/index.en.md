The ratings incentives have been extended (again) to April 1, 2022.
The updated policy is as follows:

**Extension - Internet Rated Games and COVID-19 Rating Incentive**

The CFC is extending to **April 1, 2022**
the interim policy to accept internet events for Quick (Active).

The COVID-19 rating incentive will also be extended until **April 1, 2022**.
Players who play a minimum of 10 CFC rated games between October 1st, 2020 and **April 1, 2022**
and who attain a Quick rating that is 200 points higher than their Regular rating
will have their Regular rating increased by 200 points.

The minimum time control for qualifying events is 25 minutes per player including increments.
The total time is calculated based on a 60-move game.
For example, 15 minutes per player plus a 10 second increment is 25 minutes per player.

The COVID-19 rating incentive can only be earned once in a player's lifetime where pre-bonus
rating exceeds 1200. Players with ratings under 1200 are eligible for up to __four__ 200-point
bonuses in their lifetime up to a maximum rating of 1400. Only paid-up CFC members are
eligible for this incentive.

Players, TDs or organizers may forward applications to the CFC by e-mail. Otherwise, a review
will be conducted and bonus points added at the end of the incentive period.
