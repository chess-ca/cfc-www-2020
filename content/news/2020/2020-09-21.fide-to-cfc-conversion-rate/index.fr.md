Paul Leblanc, the CFC Ratings Auditor,
is announcing a change to how CFC events are rated:

When rating events containing new players with FIDE ratings,
the CFC will assign to such players an initial CFC rating of FIDE + 125.
This will replace the current practice of accepting FIDE ratings at par.

Arbiters and organizers of CFC rated events may use this conversion rate for pairings and prize eligibility
if in their judgment it is considered appropriate.

USCF and FQE ratings will continue to be converted to CFC at par.
