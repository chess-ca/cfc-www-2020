In summary, ...

As [previously announced](/en/news/2020/06/09/cfc-memberships-extended-due-to-covid-19/),
the CFC was automatically extending memberships that expired on or after March 1, 2020.
This was done due the drastically reduced number of CFC-rated events due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On November 1, after 8 months, the CFC ended the automatic extension of memberships.
This was due to the increasing number of CFC-rated events available online to all members
across Canada as well as the return of some over the board events.

The CFC is now adding 8 months to all memberships that expired on or after March 1, 2020.
* March 1, 2020 expiry dates will be changed to November 1, 2020.
* April 1, 2020 expiry dates will be changed to December 1, 2020.
* May 1, 2020 expiry dates will be changed to January 1, 2021.
* Etc, etc.

The changes should be completed by the end of November (Bob is now working hard on this).

CFC memberships that expired before March 1, 2020 remain expired.
Please [renew your membership now](/en/players/membership-join/).
