See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess#1200%E2%80%931700:_Origins_of_the_modern_game)
and [queens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(chess)#History).

During the 15th century in Europe, the rules for chess continued their evolution
toward the modern game we now today:

* Pawns could now move two squares on its first move.

* This change necessitated the
[en passant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_(chess)#Capturing) rule.
Without en passant, a pawn could unfairly scoot past an advanced enemy pawn by moving two squares,
jumping over the square on which the enemy pawn could have captured it.

* Queens could now move like a rook and a bishop.
Prior to this change, the queen could move only 1 or 2 squares and was relatively weak.
