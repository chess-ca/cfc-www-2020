In 1945, the Canadian Chess Federation (CCF) is renamed to
the Chess Federation of Canada (CFC).

The CCF was renamed to avoid confusion with a Canadian political party also known as the CCF,
the [Co-operative Commonwealth Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-operative_Commonwealth_Federation).
The CCF party was founded in 1932. In 1961, it was succeeded by the
[New Democratic Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party_(Canada)).
