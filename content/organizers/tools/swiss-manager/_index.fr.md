The CFC has negotiated an agreement with [Swiss-Manager](http://swiss-manager.at/)!
Tournament directors in Canada can use Swiss-Manager free of charge to run their CFC tournaments.

Use the Database of CFC Members, the CFCmembers.mde file, for registration of players.
It contains both CFC and FIDE ids and ratings.
Designate ID #2 as "FIDE NUMBER" and Rating #2 as "FIDE Rating" (this should save a lot of work for all).
