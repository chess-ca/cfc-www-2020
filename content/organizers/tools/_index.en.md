Here are some useful tools for organizers and arbiters.

## Player Lookup
When you register players for your CFC-rated tournament,
you will need to lookup their CFC membership id, expiry date, and rating.

* If you **will have internet access** while registering players,
  use [Ratings](/en/ratings/).

* If you **will not have internet access** while registering players,
  get the "tdlist.txt" file from
  [HERE](https://storage.googleapis.com/cfc-public/data/tdlist.txt)
  and save it to your laptop.
  Use your favourite file editor to open this file and search for
  CFC membership ids or names.
  (Apologies, this file _is_ unfriendly. We are looking into improvements.)

## Pairings
When running your tournament, you will need to do the pairings
(who plays who with which colour).  The CFC has licensed two
software programs for use in CFC-rated tournaments.  Pick one.

* **SwissSys**: Popular as this was the first licensed by the CFC.
  See [MORE](/en/organizers/tools/swiss-sys).

* **Swiss-Manager**: Popular because you can upload pairings (before each round) and
  results (after each round) to [chess-results.com](http://chess-results.com/)
  where everyone can see it.
  See [MORE](/en/organizers/tools/swiss-manager).

* **Manual**
  Before software was available, pairings were done manually with pairing cards.
  For you old schoolers, here are pairing
  [cards](https://storage.googleapis.com/cfc-public/files/pairing-cards.pdf) and
  [sheets](https://storage.googleapis.com/cfc-public/files/pairing-sheet.pdf).

## Reporting Results to the CFC
You need to report the results of games played to the CFC for rating.

* IMPORTANT: Be prepared to send the results to the CFC as soon as possible.
  Players like to see their updated ratings quickly. In extreme cases, delayed
  ratings may mean a player must play in a different section of a future tournament
  or is or isn't selected or eligible to participate in an tournament. 

* **Pairing Software**:
  Both [SwissSys](/en/organizers/tools/swiss-sys/) and
  [Swiss-Manager](/en/organizers/tools/swiss-manager/) will create 
  result reports in the format required by the CFC.

* **Swiss Assistant**:
  If you did not use pairing software, "Swiss Assistant" is a simple tool
  for just creating the reports for CFC (for Swiss and Round Robin).
  See [MORE](/en/organizers/tools/swiss-assistant).

## Reporting Memberships to the CFC
If you collected any CFC membership fees, you will need to report these
and send the money to the CFC.
