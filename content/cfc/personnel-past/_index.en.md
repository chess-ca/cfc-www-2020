End of the volunteer era:
In 1973, the CFC hired its first (part time) employee/contractor, Les Bunning,
as Business Manager, thus transforming what had been a 100% volunteer operation.
In the same year, it began to publish CFC Bulletin, a bi-monthly magazine.
Soon thereafter, the CFC began to sell chess equipment, then chess books.

At the 1945 Annual General Meeting (AGM), the CFC was renamed from
"Canadian Chess Federation" to the "Chess Federation of Canada".
This was done to avoid confusion with a political party known as the CCF.

Our federation was formally founded in Haileybury, Ontario, in 1932.
Prior to this, records are incomplete.

Prior to 1932, our organization was known as the 
"Canadian Chess Association" (held annual Canadian Championships).

* In 1932, the Canadian Chess Federation (CCF) was founded in Haileybury, Ontario.

Other notes:

* 1936: From the Secretary's Annual Report 1935-36: "...The most important work accomplished during the past year was re-writing the Constitution.... The other event of importance was the adoption of the Canadian Chessner as our official organ."
* 1939: From a letter by T.Schofield, Jan 25, 1939 "...Our former Secretary, Mr. Trottier of Quebec City, reported at our last meeting that the "Minute Book" and all documents pertaining to our Federation were destroyed by fire at his house."
* 1940: In the Canadian Supplement to Chess - October 1940: "At the annual meeting of the CCF held at Montreal on Oct 5th it was decided that present officers would retain their positions until the new constitution, drawn up by J.P.Erichsen-Brown of Toronto, comes into force. The plan is to apply for a charter of incorporation and when this is granted the control of the Federation will be placed in the hands of a Board of Governors composed of two representatives from each province."
* 1945: Organization known as Canadian Chess Federation until 1945 Annual Meeting, then Chess Federation of Canada. At the time it was to avoid confusion with the CCF political party. Later, "putting Chess first" paid off with regard to the organization's listing in the phone book.
* 1945: The office of FIDE Representative was first suggested, and filled, at the 1945 annual meeting.
* 1971: Chess Chat Sept 1971 "After 16 solid years as President, John Prentice ..."
