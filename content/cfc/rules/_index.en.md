## Legacy

The legacy rules & bylaws of the CFC are contained in the legacy _CFC Handbook_.

Although it is no longer the "official" CFC Bylaws nor is it legally binding,
Vlad Drkulec, the current CFC president, has promised to abide by
the legacy _CFC Handbook_ as CFC policy to the extent possible consistent with the NFP Act.

# History

In 1976, the CFC became a corporation.
The Letters Patent for incorporation are contained in Section 2 of the legacy _CFC Handbook_.

In 2014, the CFC changed its structure to comply with the
[Not For Profit Corporations Act (2009)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/annualstatutes/2009_23/FullText.html).
This change was rushed to meet a deadline that, if missed,
would have dissolved the CFC and disbursed its assets to other charities.
As such, there was not enough time to convert the entire legacy CFC Handbook.
