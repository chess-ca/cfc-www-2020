**History**

Chess existed in India in about 500 AD, perhaps earlier in central Asia.
The inventor(s) of chess is unknown, but the game did evolve over a considerable period of time before reaching
its current state. From India chess spread in all directions, reaching Britain with the Norman Conquest in 1066.
In 1474 Caxton's Game and Playe of the Chesse became one of the first two printed books in English on any subject.
The 19th century brought the first newspaper chess column (1813), the first chess match by correspondence (1824),
the first chess magazine (1836), the first chess match by telegraph (1844),
and the first international chess tournament (London, 1851).
In 1866, Wilhelm Steinitz declared himself the first "World Chess Champion",
setting the stage for the founding of the Canadian Chess Association on September 24, 1872 at Hamilton.
The CCA was reorganized at Haileybury, Ontario, in 1932 as the Canadian Chess Federation (CCF),
whose name was changed to the Chess Federation of Canada in 1945.
Starting in 1932 the CFC undertook more than the organization of a regular Canadian Championship tournament.
Its activities included publishing the Rules of Chess, sending a team to the Chess Olympics - World Team Championship
in Buenos Aires in 1939, and the encouragement of the formation of chess clubs in all parts of Canada.
November 1, 1947 saw the publication of the first issue of Maritime Chess News, which later became
Canadian Chess Chat and the official publication of the Chess Federation of Canada.
The First Edition of the CFC Handbook was published in September 1956 and reset in booklet form in March 1957.
It contained the Laws of Chess, Rules of Procedure for Canadian Chess Championship tournaments, Rules of Play,
Round-Robin pairings, Swiss System pairings, and the CFC Rating System.
All in 32 small pages! Chess became more complicated, and in 1974 it was decided to replace
the Handbook with a loose-leaf format. Subsequent editions appeared in 1978, 1980 and 1983 and 1990.
This, the 1996 version, is thus the seventh edition. Several yearly revisions helped keep players and organizers
up to date with changes.
The 1950s saw two other important events in chess in Canada.
In 1954, the CFC published its first Rating List, whereby players in competitive chess tournaments
could compare their strength against any other such players in Canada.
In 1956, the first Canadian Open Chess Championship was held in Montreal.
The Rating List and the Canadian Open have become two of the most important fixtures in chess in Canada.
In the 1960s Canada became a regular competitor in international chess, sending a team to
the Chess Olympics every time it has been held (each even-numbered year) since 1964.
In 1976 our team made its best performance ever, placing 8th. The 1970s were a decade of organizational progress.
In 1970 the CFC had 1,100 members who paid an adult membership fee of $2.00 per year.
If they belonged to a club, they received an annual rating list, but nothing more.
In 1973, the CFC hired a part-time Business Manager and published the first issue of its magazine Bulletin
(later changed to Chess Canada Echecs).
Membership in the CFC included a subscription to the magazine.
Recently, the CFC ceased to publish it officially, but membership still includes a subscription En Passant magazine.
Issuance of membership cards was centralised, and in 1975 chess books and equipment were made available
to CFC members by mail order.
In 1995 the CFC went onto the Internet.
In 1996 the CFC has about 3500 members with an adult fee of $30.00 per year.

**Membership Fees**

The CFC collects provincial dues. All the affiliated provincial associations which charge dues
(BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland)
have elected to have the CFC collect theirs.
For that reason, CFC fees vary across the country. Write for current fees.

**Publications**

Each Ordinary, Junior, Life, Affiliate, Institutional or Honorary member receives a subscription
to En Passant chess magazine.
This is not an official CFC publication, but the price of subscription is included in the membership fee.
Thus every CFC member is able to keep up to date with chess in Canada.
En Passant is now available on selected news-stands across the country.

Quarterly voting ledgers contain the results of voting on motions presented to the Assembly of Governors,
specifically outlining how each Governor voted.
The full proceedings of Meetings of the Assembly are publicly available;
therefore, Minutes are not made explicitly available. Quarterly voting ledgers, however, are generally
made available between meetings. [Motion 2013-O (McKim/Bond)]

The CFC Handbook contains the CFC Constitution and Bylaws, the Laws of Chess,
regulations on how to pair Swiss system tournaments and Round-robins, a description of the CFC rating system,
regulations governing the various Canadian Championships, selection criteria for International competitions,
and much more.
New editions will appear regularly and will incorporate changes to the Handbook resulting
from Motions of the CFC Governors.

**Affiliations**

The CFC is affiliated with FIDE (La Fédération Internationale des Echecs, the World Chess Federation).
It should be noted that the CFC is a charitable and non-governmental organization which does not receive aid
from the federal government.
The CFC has as its Provincial Affiliates eight provincial associations
(Quebec having been expelled for not meeting financial requirements and PEI having no provincial authority)
and the Canadian Correspondence Chess Association.
A separate Affiliate program (not to be confused with Provincial Affiliations)
encourages chess organization at all levels.

**Governors**

The polices of the CFC are set by the Board of Governors, which are selected under the provisions of By-Law Two.
The list of current Governors may be found each year in the annual issue of En Passant, which appears in August.

write to the Governor who submitted the resolution, setting forth comments and suggestions.

c) If the resolution is already in satisfactory form to be voted on by the Assembly,
or if it is subsequently revised so as to be in a satisfactory form to be voted on by the Assembly,
the President shall then refer it back to the Secretary, who will make copies and transmit one copy
to each member of the Assembly, accompanied by a letter wherein each Assembly member
will be instructed to either record his vote (Yes or No) or to propose an amendment,
the vote or amendment to be in the Secretary's hands by a date to be fixed by the President.

d) If votes are received by the Secretary but no amendments,
he shall communicate the results of the voting to the President,
and upon receiving the President's instructions shall inform each member of the Assembly
if the resolution has been approved or not.

e) If the Secretary has received any amendments within the time limit,
he shall make copies of same and shall mail them to the Assembly members for further amendment or comment,
with a further time limit for replies. If at the expiration of such second time limit
it appears to the President the matter has become too involved to make a decision by mail,
the President shall have the right to defer any action on the resolution until the next meeting of the Assembly.

f) If, on the other hand, it appears that the resolution can be voted on as drafted or amended,
the Secretary shall transmit the resolution, together with any proposed amendments,
to each Assembly member to be voted on, accompanied by a letter,
in which it will be stated that no further amendments will be received and the votes should be recorded
in any form to be specified by the President.
The President may require any amendment to be voted first,
and may also require any Assembly member to cast a contingent vote upon any resolution
as originally drafted, in the event of an amendment being defeated.

g) On all matters of procedure, the decision of the President shall govern.

h) In the event that a majority of the votes received by the Secretary within the time limit
specified by the President, is in favour of the Resolution or amended Resolution,
and provided the requirements of Article Seven, Section Five, are met where applicable the Resolution
shall be inserted in the Minute Book, and shall be as valid and effectual as a decision of the Assembly,
as if it had been passed at an Annual Meeting.

i) In the event of any resolution or amended resolution being rejected
by such majority of the Assembly, all correspondence, notes, drafts, re-drafts, etc.,
shall be retained in a file by the Secretary and no records shall be entered in the Minute Book,
but the same shall be referred to the next ensuing Annual Meeting of the Assembly,
who may direct a summary or record of the matter he inserted in the Minute Book for purposes of record
as such meeting may consider advisable.

# SECTION 4 - CFC Rating System & FIDE Rated Events

**401.**
Overview Ratings provide a way to compare the strengths of two players
without requiring them to play each other.

A rating is a number that may range from about 300 to about 2800. A player rated 100 points higher
than another should expect to win 5 games out of 8. If the difference is 200, the higher rated
should win 3 of 4; for 300 it's 7 of 8. Three out of four could be three wins and one loss
or two wins and two draws.

A player may become rated by competing in a CFC-rated event of 3 or more rounds.
Ratings may go up or down based on results in CFC-rated events.

By tradition, a player rated over 2200 is called a Master.
Only about 1% of all competitive players are Masters.
The other traditional classifications are:
2000 - 2199 Candidate Master [Motion 87-8» see GL, October 1986, p. 26];
1800 - 1999 Class A (or Category I);
1600 - 1799 Class B ( or Category II);
1400 - 1599 Class C (III);
1200 - 1399 Class D (IV);
below 1200 Class E (V).

The titles of International Master and Grandmaster are awarded by the World Chess Federation (FIDE).
They correspond roughly to ratings of 2400 and 2500.
The highest rated active player is World Champion Gary Kasparov at 2800,
achieved with the January 1, 1990 FIDE list.

Previously, the highest rating ever was Bobby Fischer's in 1972 - 2780.
An average competitive player is about 1750; a bright beginner about 1200.

**402. National Rating Committee:**
Whereas it is widely accepted that the CFC rating system is in need of both near term adjustments
and an accurate longer term method of monitoring the rating system to ensure the ongoing integrity
of the rating system. 

Be it resolved that the CFC establish a National Rating Committee responsible for both implementing
near term adjustments to the rating system and establishing a credible long term monitoring process. 

{2005-06 GL10 Bond/Urquhart}

**410. ESSENTIAL REGULATIONS**

**411. Rateable Tournaments:**
To be rated under the CFC "standard" rating system the time control must be at least 60 minutes per player
for the game (or for 60 moves with increment).
To be rated under the CFC Quick rating system the time control must be at least 5 minutes
but less than 60 minutes per player for the game (or for 60 moves with increment).

There may be many complicated time controls.
The intention is to stick to the maximum game time.
Non sudden death time controls shall not have a rate of play exceeding one move per minute.
For both rating systems, all secondary time controls must be a minimum of 5 minutes long.

All games in a tournament should fit the same category.
All time controls of a tournament must be advertised and/or posted prior to the tournament.
Any Quick rated tournament must be advertised as such prior to the tournament.

During a rated event, no player is allowed to be in competition with more than 1 opponent,
including opponents in other events.
[CFC Executive motion carried, 2001-02]

The Executive Director has discretion to accept or refuse any tournament for rating where the intent
of this rule has not been followed.
[see Motion 90-11, as amended, GL, September 1990, p. 1-13 - 1-14]

All events rated Standard/Regular should:
 
1. use chess clocks

2. require both players to record moves

3. have time set for no less than game in 60 minutes per player
   (may include increments based on 60 moves) (CFC Handbook article 411)

4. have time controls and round times advertised in pre-event advertising and posted
   on organizer's website (CFC Handbook article 411)

5. have no more than 4 games per day

6. include the exact time control with the rating submission to the CFC

Otherwise, events must be submitted for Active/Quick Rating.
Rare exemptions may be granted on the recommendation of the Rating Auditor
and approved by the CFC Executive.
[Motion 2012-U Leblanc/McKim]

**411.1 Quick Chess:**
[Motion 2012-P Armstrong/McKim] 
That CFC combine the current "Active" and "Blitz" Rating Systems,
and expand them into one system called a "Quick Chess" Rating System, on the following terms:
 
1. it will accept "quick chess" tournaments with time control from Game/5
   ( with increments Game/3 with 2 sec. increment ) to Game/59.
   Games 15-59 min. will be the regular K factor ( 2200+ - 16; U 2200 - 32 ),
   while those 5-14 min. will be one-half K factor ( 2200+ - 8; U 2200 – 16 ).

2. Prior to establishing the new "Quick" rating, all "Active" ratings that are more than 100 points
   below the "regular" rating will be revised to CFC regular - 100.
   The CFC "quick" rating will be the maximum of the CFC Rating (if any games played since 2006/01/01)
   and the CFC "active" (if any games played since 2006/01/01).

3. Players must be CFC members. Alternatively, a modified tournament playing fee will suffice:
   the CFC portion of the quick chess tournament playing fee is the normal CFC portion
   of the tournament playing fee reduced from $16 to $8 (adult) and from $8 to $4 (junior);
   added to this will be the applicable provincial dues.
   The price for the "quick chess" tournament playing fee will be reviewed
   by the executive after 6 months.

4. The "quick chess tournament" rating fee will be 50% of the normal rating fee. 

5. The current practice of all-junior tournaments of less than 1 hour not requiring
   any CFC membership or tournament playing fee, and being rated for $0.50 per player,
   will continue as an exception in the system.

**411.2 Rating of Junior Events:**

{Removed, see 2005-06 GL9 Mallon / McDonald} [Original Motion See GL2 1999-2000, October 1999]

**412. Current Ratings:**
All events are normally rated in chronological order with the current ratings from CFC files. When an event is rated, the ratings produced become the new current ratings and are used for the next calculations. The ratings of players who are inactive are still valid, except that the ratings of players rated under 1400 are cancelled after 5 years of inactivity. [ref: GL, September 1979, p.25]

**413. Matches:**
Individual matches are rated with the following restrictions:

a) the maximum change allowed as a result of a match is 50 points;

b) match results must be dated and signed by both players;

c) the rating difference between the two players must not exceed 400 points.

**414. Equations:**
The equations used to calculate ratings are as follows:

a) For previously unrated and provisionally rated players, the performance rating is:

>Rp = Rc + 400 (W - L) / N

where Rp is the performance rating, Rc is the average rating of the player's opponents,
W is the number of wins, L is the number of losses, N is the total number of games played.

b) For players with established ratings the new rating is

>Rn = Ro + 32 (S - Sx)

In applying this equation to players of 2199 or over, change 32 to 16.
For players who start an event below 2199 and then in the event go above 2199 the gains are computed normally,
namely with 32 in 414b and then the increase over 2199 is cut in half.
For players who start an event above 2199 and then in the event go below 2200 the loss is computed normally,
namely with 16 in 414b and then the decrease under 2200 is doubled. 

Where Rn is the post event (new) rating before the application of bonus or participation points,
Ro is the pre event (old) rating, S is the score, and Sx is the expected score.
This is determined by the following table to two significant decimals
(a more accurate determination of the expected score may be used in the actual calculation):

<table style="max-width:600px;">

c) Participation Bonus Points {Motion 2008-10 GL6 Stockhausen/Craver}
{Eliminated July 2010 AGM Toronto} 

d) Result Bonus Points [Motion 2012-S Leblanc/McKim]

> BONUS<sub>1</sub> = a * R<sub>MaxBonus</sub> * K<sub>e</sub>
> <br>BONUS<sub>2</sub> = b * R<sub>ChangeBonus</sub> * (R<sub>new</sub> – R<sub>old</sub> – Threshold) * K<sub>e</sub>
> <br>BONUS<sub>Total</sub> = BONUS<sub>1</sub> + BONUS<sub>2</sub>

where:

* No bonus points are awarded if less than 4 games are played;
* a = 1 if the new rating is at an all time high, 0 otherwise;
* b = 1 if R<sub>new</sub> > (R<sub>old</sub> + Threshold), 0 otherwise;
* Threshold = R<sub>ChangeThreshold</sub> * K<sub>e</sub> * sqrt(n)
  <br>where n is the number of games played;
* K<sub>e</sub> is the ratio of the player's K factor to the K factor used for players rated under 2200;
  * For the CFC rating system, K=32 for players under 2200 and K=16 for players at or over 2200;
* R<sub>new</sub> is the post-event rating
* R<sub>old</sub> is the pre-event rating;
* R<sub>MaxBonus</sub> = 20 (a constant);
* R<sub>ChangeBonus</sub> = 1.75 (a constant);
* R<sub>ChangeThreshold</sub> = 13 (a constant).

The numerical values in the bonus point equation may be adjusted from time to time by the Rating Auditor
as deemed necessary and in consultation with the CFC Executive.

**415. Initial Ratings:**
Previously unrated players are rated by equation 414a for their first 24 games.
The equation is applied cumulatively - i.e. the rating after the second event will include the performance
in both the first and second events.
During this period their ratings are considered provisional.
Beginning with the event in which they play their 25th rated game,
their ratings become established and are computed by equation 414b, and, if appropriate, 414c, or 414d.

**416.**
For a player with a pre-event rating below 800.

a) If a player's post tournament rating (including any participation and bonus points)
is less than 800, and the player had a permanent rating before the tournament greater than 799,
the player is entered in the rating list at 799.

b) If a player's post tournament rating (including any participation and bonus points)
is less than 800, and the player had a permanent rating before the tournament less than or equal to 799,
the player is entered in the rating list at the greater of the player's pre and post tournament ratings.

c) If a player's post tournament rating (including any participation and bonus points)
is less than 200, the player is entered in the rating list at 200.
This applies to both provisional and permanent ratings. 

**417. Order of Calculation:**
[Motion 2012-N Leblanc/McKim] 

When there are unrated and provisionally rated players,
players are rated in the following order and methodology: 

1. a) If the percentage of unrated players in the tournament is greater than 50%,
   the unrated players are assigned a preliminary average rating by the operator of the program.

   b) If the percentage of unrated players is equal to or less than 50%,
   then for each rated player, the value
   <code>R<sub>prelim</sub> = R<sub>o</sub> - 400 * (W-L) / N</code>
   is calculated (i.e. the performance rating of his opponents).
   The unrated players are assigned a preliminary rating of the average of
   <code>R<sub>prelim</sub> - 200</code>.

2. Unrated players are then rerated to give a 2nd temporary performance rating
using the temporary rating from step 1for unrated opponents and the ratings
of provisional and established rated opponents

3. Provisionally rated players are rated to give an event performance rating
and event post event rating using the temporary rating of unrated opponents calculated in step 2
and the ratings of provisional and established rated opponents

4. Unrated players are re-rated to give a provisional post event rating using the temporary ratings
of unrated opponents from step 2, the post event ratings of provisional rated opponents from step 3,
and the ratings of established rated players

5. Established rated players are rated using the post event ratings of unrated players from step 4,
the post event rating of provisional rated players from step 3, and the pre-event ratings
of established rated players.

6. Bonus and participation points, if any, are added.

7. Adjustments, if any, to final ratings are made (e.g. for players affected by Handbook 416)

**418. Late Arrival Forfeits and Undeclared Dropouts:**
If a player either forfeits a game by arriving late or does not advise the TD that he/she has withdrawn
from a tournament and subsequently loses a game by default, that game is treated like a game actually played
and is rated.
If the TD deems that circumstances beyond the individual's control prevented the defaulting player from attending,
that player may be awarded a zero point bye or half point bye at the TDs discretion.
A game is not rated when both opponents fail to appear for the game.
A defaulting player will not normally be paired for subsequent rounds
unless prior arrangements are made with the TD.

**419. Insufficient Information:**
Events can be rated if at least one of the players has a rating.
If none of the players has a rating, the report may be set aside for rating later,
when at least one of the players gains a rating.

**425. SAMPLE CALCULATION**

Let's say a player with an established rating of 1450 takes part in a 6 round event.
He scores 4-2 against opponents rated 1237, 1511, 1214, 1441, 1579 and 2133.
By equation 414b his new rating is

>1450 + 32(4 - (.77 + .42 + .80 + .51 + .33 + .01)) =  1450 + 32 (4 - 2.84 ) = 1487

Finished? No. Rule 414c provides for Bonus points.

>Rt = 1487 - 1450 - 28 = 9.
><br>New rating 1487 + 9 = 1496.

What if my calculation differs from the published rating? There are several possible reasons:
a) check your arithmetic;
b) any of the ratings may not be the most current due to intervening events;
c) Under rule 417 a player's rating is frequently based on the post-event ratings of some of his opponents.

**430. SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS**

**431. Fee:**
Effective May 1st, 2009 the Rating Fee for Adult Tournaments will be $3 per person per tournament
if using CFC/SwissSys, $5 per person per tournament if not using CFC/SwissSys.
The Rating Fee for Junior Tournaments will be $0.50 per person per Tournament if using CFC/SwissSys,
$2.50 per person if not using CFC/SwissSys.
Tournaments submitted Swiss Assistant shall receive the same rate as those using CFC/SwissSys.
{2008/09 GL5 Lavin/Smith}

**432. Membership:**
All players in a rated event must be CFC members for the inclusive dates of play.
The CFC membership requirement is waived for Junior events (tournaments or matches)
with the exception of the CYCC, Canadian Junior, or any FIDE-rated tournament.
[2013-E Bond/Gillanders]
An event is considered Junior for the purposes of this section if all the players meet the age requirements
of the World Junior of the year following the year in which the event ends.
[Updated; Keshet/Stockhausen 1999]

**433. Report:**
Rating reports should include the name and CFC number of all players.
Address changes should be noted on the membership - not the rating - report.
It is not necessary to submit a record of the moves of a game in any rated event.
We only need to know the results.

It is not necessary to redraw the crosstable in order of finish.
Please use consecutive pairing numbers, starting at 1.
Avoid for example, pairing numbers such as 22A.

Forms are available free of charge for reporting all events, and memberships collected.

An event will not normally be rated if the report is received more than three months after its end.
A report should be submitted within one week of the end of an event.

**434. Publication:**
A rating becomes published once a player plays 3 or more games.
If a player has played less than three rated games, only the name and number of games are published:

>JONES JANE /2

If a player has a provisional rating based on 3 to 24 games,
the rating is followed by a / and the number of games:

>JONES JOHN 1471/14

Once a player has played 25 rated games the number of games is dropped:

>JONES JENNIFER 1531o16

The "o16" is called the rating indicator.
It is the first two digits of the highest established rated achieved since the list published in En Passant # 64.
Thus o16 indicates a peak rating between 1600 and 1699.
[With a new ratings program now in production the CFC will have on record the highest lifetime rating of all players.]

It is the responsibility of the organizers to ensure that all players are CFC members.
We realize that it is possible to overlook a player.
We will still rate the tournament, but the rating of a player who does not fulfill CFC membership requirements
will be deactivated. xxxx will appear after his name:

>JONES,JEREMIAH xxxx

Such a player would not be eligible for class prizes,
and special care should be taken to check his membership.
Note in the last example that the surname and given name were separated by a comma.
This indicates a Junior or Participating member.
Ordinary members are separated by a space.

**436. Non-CFC Ratings:**
If a new player has an FQE, USCF or FIDE rating,
the rating system in which the player has played the most recent games will be used
to determine their first CFC rating.
If a player is inactive in CFC events for a year but has a significant change in their FQE, USCF or FIDE rating,
their CFC rating will be adjusted accordingly.

A Canadian may have an FQE, USCF or FIDE rated tournament count for their CFC rating
by sending a notice and a $25 payment to the CFC office at least one month before the tournament.
(Leblanc/Denomme October 2016)

**437. Rating Boon:**
One June 15, 1980 all players active since June 30, 1974 were given points to counteract deflation.
The added points depended upon rating.

If the rating was below 972, it was increased 188 points;
1028 to 1196 = +133; 1204 to 1395 = +127; 1404 to 1509 = + 120; 1612 to 1799 = + 99;
1800 to 1906 = +101; 2003 and above = + 96;

Ratings not given above went to the highest level for the next lower group.

**438. Rating Classes, Titles and Certificates:**
[Motion 2012-G Mallon/Drkulec] 

a) The CFC officially recognizes the following titles, rating classes and CFC rating floors:
National Master (2200), National Candidate Master (2000),
Class A (1800), Class B (1600), Class C (1400), Class D (1200), and Class E (1000).

b) To achieve standing for any class or title, the player must:

i. Have at some point had a published CFC rating above the minimum rating floor for that class or title

ii. Have in three separate tournaments achieved a norm, which is a performance rating
at least 100 points above the rating floor

iii. For the purposes of these norms, only CFC regular ratings count,
and the player must have played at least five games.

iv. Matches may not be used as a norm.

v. An event can be used as a norm for multiple classes.
For example,a 2300 performance event can be a norm used by the same player for Class A,
National Candidate Master AND National Master.

vi. Titles and Classes are not awarded to Foreign players or members.

vii. Rating Floors are used only as the minimum required published rating to achieve titles or classes,
and do not prevent a  member's rating from dropping below the rating floor for that member's title or class.

viii. At any time, should a member's published, established regular rating exceed 100 points
above the rating floor for a title, they will achieve that title even if they do not have sufficient norms.

c) Certificates. The CFC will provide, free of charge, certificates to those who achieve
the title of National Master or any higher title that the CFC chooses to award.
Certificates for lower titles or classes are not automatically provided, but may be requested.
The CFC Executive is empowered to set a fee for this service not to exceed $10 including shipping.

**439. Appeals:**
[Motion 2012-N Leblanc/McKim] 

If a player thinks an error has been made in his published rating he has the right to appeal.
If the believed error is of a simple nature which can be quickly checked
(e.g. misprints, confusion between two players with the same name etc.)
the player should write to the CFC office and the matter will be sorted out expeditiously.
If the player is still unsatisfied with the CFC office ruling,
or if the error is of a non-straightforward nature, the player can formally appeal to the Rating Auditor.
Games are only rated by the CFC if results are submitted to the CFC office together
with the appropriate fee and evidence of CFC membership of the players.
Appeals on the basis of the non-rating of games which do not satisfy the above will not be upheld.
The Rating Auditor's decision on an appeal will be final.
The Rating Auditor is required to provide his detailed calculations on his rulings
on ratings when so requested by a provincial affiliate.

**440. Rating Internet Games:**
[Motion 2012-T Leblanc/McKim]

Events played over the internet may be submitted for CFC rating provided that:

i) Conditions of play are advertised ahead of the event and agreed to by all participants

ii) A non-playing TD must be present at each playing site to ensure that normal tournament regulations
and playing conditions are upheld.

iii) Along with all the information that is usually sent to CFC,
an event that has games played on the internet shall also provide the following information:

a) moves from games played over the internet

b) The names of TDs present at each site,

c) provide the website where the games took place.

d) provide the internet handles of the participants.

**441. CFC/FIDE/USCF/FQE Rating Adjustments:**
A player who has attained a FIDE, USCF or FQE rating that is 200 or more points higher
than his/her CFC rating may request that their CFC rating be adjusted
to match their other rating, provided that player has played at least 10 games in the other system
in the 12 months prior to the request. {October 2014, LeBlanc / Drkulec}

**490. FIDE-Rated Events:**
Events may be rated by FIDE if they meet the following requirements: {Motion 2005-18 GL6 Barron/Dougherty}

a) In a Round-Robin, at least 4 of the players must be rated.

b) In a Swiss or Team event, only games against rated players are counted.
If a player meets less than 3 rated opponents in an event,
that event will not count towards his rating.

c) Each player must have a minimum of 120 minutes for a game, assuming the game lasts 60 moves.
No more than three rounds per day and a total playing time of no more than 12 hours per day are allowed.

d) The event must be pre-registered with the CFC office.
The FIDE Events pre-registration form to be sent to the CFC office is here.
The crosstable must be sent to the CFC within one week of the completion of the event
along with an updated event registration form, and the FIDE rating fee payment.

e) The following scheduled FIDE rating fee structure is payable to the CFC provided the event
is submitted within 1 week to the CFC office.
If the event is submitted to the CFC Office after 1 week then there is a $110 late fee
due to the policies of FIDE. [see Motion 2003-05; 02-03GL4, January 2003]

Round Robin & Matches: Avg rating under 2300 $100, Avg rating 2300-2399 $200,
Avg rating 2400-2499 $300, Avg rating 2500-2599 $400, Avg rating 2600+ $600.

Swiss & Team Tournaments: Number of players multiplied by $2.20

f) For the time being no FIDE rating fees will be required for ladies' tournaments
although these tournaments as a matter of course shuld be registered.

g) Small tournaments such as local Swiss tournaments shall be exempt from FIDE rating fees.

h) All Canadian players who compete in a FIDE registered event must be members in good standing of the CFC,
or possess a valid tournament passport prior to the start of the tournament. [2013-H Bond/McKim]

Upon completion of a FIDE-registered event, the CFC will put the crosstable in the required form
and send it along to FIDE. Note that rated in a) and b) means FIDE-rated.
Lists of Canadian FIDE-rated players are available from the ratings page on our website.

**491. FIDE TITLES:**
Any player from Canada who applies for a FIDE player title must have maintained a CFC rating
for at least 15 games, which is not more than 100 points below the FIDE benchmark
for the title/norm in question.

| TITLE | FIDE Benchmark | Minimum CFC Rating |
|:-----:|:--------------:|:------------------:|
|FM|2300|2200|
|IM|2451|2351|
|GM|2601|2501|
|WFM|2100|2000|
|WIM|2251|2151|

shall have the right to determine who shall be their Provincial Champion
by choosing as their champion either the winner of a Provincial Championship Tournament
who meets the requirements of 504(a) or the highest rated player
who meets the requirements of 504(b).

a) To qualify a Provincial Championship Tournament must be held no earlier than two years
or later than 4 weeks prior to the start of the the Canadian Championship or Zonal Tournament.
It must be a CFC rated closed tournament restricted to players ordinarily resident in the Province
at least six months prior to the start of the the Canadian Championship or Zonal Tournament

# SECTION 6 - Requirements and Guidelines for Important Events

**600. GUIDELINES FOR MAJOR TOURNAMENTS**

Original section by Phil Haley, International Arbiter, Member FIDE Rules Commission.

In evaluating bids for important events in Canada, a factor shall be whether the bidder
has made every effort to provide: (1) good playing conditions for the participants;
and (2) good viewing conditions for the spectators.
Consideration should be given to the following points:

**601.** Good lighting in all parts of the room.

**602.** Air Conditioning.

**603.** Low noise level. Carpeting is highly desirable.
If the whole playing area cannot be carpeted, the area in which the top boards are located
should be carpeted as should the area under the chairs for spectators.
It is unlikely that a satisfactorily low noise level will be achieved unless the tournament director
and the organizers control the noise level during the first round so that the spectators and participants
realize from the start of the tournament that a quiet environment is the natural state for the tournament.

**604.** A minimum of 3 demonstration boards should be provided for the top boards.
Demonstration boards should be large with marked contrast in colours.
[see Motion 2010-14]

The demonstration boards should be located high enough so that the lower part
of the boards are not obscured by the players.

Markers should be provided to indicate on the demonstration boards whether
it is White or Black's move as well as the move number.

**607.**
Time consumed by each player should be conspicuously displayed adjacent to the demonstration boards.
This can be readily done with a hand controlled digital time display.

**608.**
Personnel assigned to the demonstration boards should be well trained in their duties
such that they can perform them accurately and unobtrusively.
As soon as a game is concluded, the result should be clearly indicated on the demonstration board.
This is frequently not done and as a result there is marked increase in the noise level
as spectators ask each other what happened.
This, of course, disturbs the games still in progress.
It is unlikely that demonstration boards can be successfully handled by personnel
who do not have a good appreciation for the game.

**609.**
There should be a large masterclock in the main playing room to be used
for starting all rounds precisely on time.

**610.**
There should be a separate room for skittles and analysis.

**611.**
Convenient facilities should be available for players and spectators to obtain coffee,
soft drinks and sandwiches while the games are in progress.
These should be located in a separate room adjacent to the main playing area
and located such that neither noise from nor traffic to these facilities
will disturb the players.

**612.**
FIDE-approved pieces, boards and clocks should be provided by the organizers.
Good quality standardized sets and boards should be provided for all games.
If paper boards are to be used, there should be ample supplies to provide immediate replacement
of those that have become dirty or whose corners have begun to curl.
[see Motion 2010-14]

**613.**
There should be an adequate supply of clocks and spares with each side of each clock having been
tested for accuracy over a minimum period of one hour before the start of the tournament.

**614.**
To the extent possible and particularly on the top boards,
the clocks should be ones where the minute hand picks up the flag
and moves to the extreme end of the flag before the flag falls.
Clocks that have a side flag or that have an attachment behind the flag
such that the flag falls before the minute hand reaches the end of the flag,
can lead to arguments in time problems.

**615.**
All boards, chess pieces and clocks should be properly set up and ready to go
30 minutes before the start of the round.

**616.**
It should be possible to lock and isolate the main playing room between rounds.

**617.**
Clear and easily seen numbers should be provided to readily show the location of each board.
The boards should be numbered in logical sequence to enable each player
to find his board with ease thus avoiding excess milling around at the start of each round.
Name cards should be made for all top players (all players in the Canadian Closed/Zonal tournament),
with name, rating, title (if any) and province noted and displayed at their board.
[see Motion 2010-14]

**618.**
No photographs should be allowed after the first five minutes of each round.

**619.**
Score sheets should be provided with provision for copies so that one copy can be turned in
and one copy retained by the player.
Attached carbonless copies are preferable with built in carbon paper a second choice.
Loose carbon paper should not be used.

**620.**
The score sheets should be designed to provide space for names of both players,
the board number, round number and a clear indication of results.
There should be a solid easily visible line at the first time control point.

**621.**
The tournament director should prepare a handout that clearly covers the playing schedule,
time controls, pairing considerations, etc.
A copy of this handout should be given to each player when he registers.

**622.**
A large notice board should be provided with room for individual players' scores, announcements,
pairings, standings etc.
This board should be in a well lighted location preferably outside of but near
the entrance of the main playing room.
If the playing room is extraordinarily large, the notice board can be located
in a remote corner at a distance from all players.

**623.**
The score board should be a focal point of interest.
To serve its proper role, it should be large and neatly arranged.
It should be kept up-to-date continuously as games are finished and not merely updated between rounds.
In addition to the score board listing all players in order of rating,
there should be a large clearly visible display of the top players
in order of standing at the completion of each round.

**624.**
Pairings should be posted in several locations preferably outside the main playing room.
There should be sufficient copies posted to avoid crowding and delay occasioned
by all players trying to ascertain their board number and opponent from one list of pairings.

**625.**
An adequate supply of specially designed sealed move envelopes should be available.
Each envelope should include a diagram for recording the sealed move position
and spaces to show the names of the players, the board number, the move number,
the time on each player's clock and the time for resuming the game.

**626.**
Provision should be made for handling admission fees for spectators.
It is suggested that the admission fee be sufficiently high to ensure that the number of spectators
is in keeping with the facilities provided.
A reasonable number of seats should be sold as reserved seats at a higher price.
Each reserved seat should be individually numbered.
This enables the reserved seat holder to leave his seat for a period of time
without fear of someone else taking it.
It is suggested that the minimum admission fee be at least $1.00 per round with $2.00
being more appropriate.
These sums will not discourage attendance of the true enthusiast.
If we do not value our tournaments this highly, it is unlikely that spectators
will value them very highly either.

**627.**
A separate table should be provided for checking each participant's
Chess Federation of Canada membership prior to registration of the participant
as a player in the tournament.

**628.**
A handout should be given to each spectator.
This handout should include information on (a) The Chess Federation of Canada
(b) The Chess Foundation (c) The Tournament in Progress
and (d) Information and Advice for Spectators.

**629.**
The tournament director should be provided with a locked room adjacent
to the main playing room for use in making pairings, etc.

**630.**
The tournament director should be provided with a desk in the main playing room.
The desk should preferably be in an elevated location with a clear view of all players.

**631.**
If possible, individual tables (of solid construction to avoid wobbling)
should be provided for each game.
(Long tables for many games make it difficult for the director and assistant directors
to monitor time control situations.)

**632.**
The top boards should be located on an elevated stage with a demonstration board for each.
For major events, it is suggested that wall boards be provided for a minimum of five boards.

**633.**
For the Canadian Closed, whether or not a Zonal, round by round bulletins should be provided,
either online or in print.
These should include all the games from each round. [see Motion 2010-14]

**634.**
For the Canadian Closed, whether or not a Zonal, a tournament website should be created
with a minimum of: Live transmission of the top 3 boards;
A players list and pairings and standings after each round;
Photos of the players and the event.
[see Motion 2010-14]

**640. Smoking**

**641.**
Smoking is not permitted in any national event.
It shall be considered part of a bid for any national event that smoking is prohibited,
and all advertizing for any national event shall carry this message.
[see Motion 84-16;GL, July 1983, p. 1-13]

**642.**
Any advertisement for a chess event carried in the magazine shall have a message indicating
whether smoking is allowed or not.
[see Motion 84-17; GL, July 1983, p. 1-13]

**Canadian Open Bid Requirement**

**394. CFC Retail Rights:** 
[Motion Bunning /Stockhausen in 2008-09 GL1 AGM]: 
Unless a bid specifically specifies that they will not do so,
the organizers of both the CYCC and the Canadian Open must provide at no cost to the CFC
a suitable space, in terms of size and location, where the CFC can sell books and equipment.
The CFC may conduct these sales from it's own stocks or may contract this right out
if it is deemed appropriate to do so.

**643.**

a) It is a condition for acceptance of any bid for the Canadian open that residents of provinces
other than the host province not be charged host province provincial dues.
[see Motion 80-21; GL, June 1980, p. 125]

b) All entry fees to the Canadian Open shall be sent directly to the Business Office
of the Chess Federation of Canada.
[ref: GL, November 1987, Appendix A, p. 1-44]

**Uncontested Bids for National Tournaments**

**644.**
If the published deadline for bids has passed, the CFC Executive is empowered to award
all national tournaments unless there are two or more conflicting bids.
[see Motion 80-20; GL, June 1980, p. 125]

**Competing Bids**

**645.**
In all cases where competing bids are presented at an annual meeting,
for an event to be held 10 months or more from the date of the annual meeting;

a) such bids shall not be voted on at an annual meeting

b) such bids shall be sent out for vote with the next following Governor's letter

c) such bids shall be discussed at the annual meeting and any Governor present
at the annual meeting may provide comments on the bid for transmission with
the motion covering the bid.
[see Motion 83-19; GL, November 1982, p. 2-5]

**646. Limitation on Rule Changes:**
Any motion which seeks to amend or replace existing rules, as approved by the Governors,
of eligibility for a Canadian Championship Tournament or for the selection
of an official Canadian team shall be declared out of order by the President
if such a motion is proposed within nine calendar months
of the scheduled starting date of the event in question.

**660. Guidelines for FIDE Events in Canada:**
For all events, excepting intra-Canadian Zonals which are awarded by FIDE
through the bid process, the CFC will oppose any bid to hold an event in Canada
unless the organizer has paid 120% of the FIDE fees, deposits and rating fees applicable
to that event to the CFC. FIDE will be advised of the CFC's opposition.
After the event, the CFC will refund the 20%, less any CFC expenses incurred incidental to the event.
Any of the FIDE money which does not become payable will also be returned
following written confirmation from FIDE.
This does not in any way preclude the CFC from collecting a fee for its endorsement.
[see Motion 90-10, as amended, GL, September 1990, p. 1-12].

**670. Guaranteed Prize Funds:**
Prize funds are guaranteed unless otherwise stated.
For full wording of this motion, see section 1150.

[Sections 681. to 686. result from Motion 84-15; GL, July 1983, p. 1-12]

**687. CFC Funding of the Men's Zonal:**
CFC policy is to fund the Men's Zonal tournaments by setting aside $2,000.00

Where the shortfall occurs in the girls U18, it is recommended that this section be combined
with the girls U16.
If their insufficient numbers in this combined U18 & U16 girls section,
then the U14 Girls should be included with both these sections.

**703. Players:**
{Motion 2009-13 2009 AGM Nadeau/Lavin}
The following players shall be eligible to participate in each Youth Tournament

{Motion Bunning/Taylor in 2002-3 GL1 From AGM}: 
<strike>The Executive may allow exceptional players to move up to a higher age group</strike>.

CFC policy on playing up in an older section of the CYCC as articulated by then CFC youth coordinator
Patrick McDonald February 2012:

If someone wants to play in an age category older than the one they qualify for, they can do so.

BUT: if they win a spot in a certain age category to play at the WYCC,
that is the age category that we are willing to send them to the WYCC in.

IE: if one player who is 9 years old, wishes to play in the U14 section at the CYCC,
and if they win a spot to go to the WYCC, the only age category that Canada will send them
to the WYCC in is the U14 section.

The same would go for girls that would like to play in the open section for their age group
(or older) ... if a girl plays in the open section and wins a spot to go to the WYCC,
then the only section that Canada will send them to the WYCC in is the section that they qualified in at the CYCC.

{Motion Palsson/Doubleday 2007-08 GL1 From AGM}: 
The organizers may charge a late fee not exceeding $50 for entry fees received after the deadline.
The CFC Executive may authorize an increase in entry fees after 2009 where it is considered appropriate
because of inflation or other increases in expenses.
Where there are 2 children in any one family, ie. brothers and sisters, the entry fee for the third family member
shall be 50% and the 4th and subsequent family members shall be free.

Reminder:  394. CFC Retail Rights: 
{Motion Bunning /Stockhausen in 2008-09 GL1 AGM}: 
Unless a bid specifically specifies that they will not do so,
the organizers of both the CYCC and the Canadian Open must provide at no cost to the CFC
a suitable space, in terms of size and location, where the CFC can sell books and equipment.
The CFC may conduct these sales from it's own stocks or may contract this right out
if it is deemed appropriate to do so.

**709. Time Control:**

and fascinating pastime and mental exercise; is of the greatest value in providing
intellectual recreation and guidance for the people of Canada and particularly for our Canadian youth
and also in providing physical and psychological aid to the sick and the handicapped;

AND WHEREAS it has also been proved that training in the art and skills of Chess develops
powers of concentration and controlled imagination and that the pursuit of the game fosters self-control,
patience, perseverance and keen sportsmanship, contributing to the production of the finest citizens,
and helping to combat the problem of juvenile delinquency, and bridge the gaps of race, sex and status;

AND WHEREAS with the aforesaid benefits in mind, it is one of the main objectives of
the Chess Federation of Canada to have Chess introduced into our schools, hospitals and recreation centres

and mischief and to direct their thoughts in clear and logical thinking, to build better citizens
and to give them a hobby to stay with them for life; 

AND WHEREAS the Chess Federation of Canada is striving for progress not only in the areas

called the "Kalev Pugi Chess Education Fund".
Subsequent donations have increased this amount to $20,000 (as of 2009).
The income generated from that fund is to go toward assisting young Canadian chess players
under the age of 18 years to travel to chess competitions and tournaments
for the purpose of increasing their chess playing skills and education. 

It is the responsibility of the Chess Foundation of Canada to manage the money
in accordance with the terms of the will.
At the Annual General Meeting of the Chess Federation of Canada each year,
a committee of three persons is elected to select any players for assistance from the fund
that have a need and meet the qualifications under the terms of the will.
Applications from or on behalf of eligible recipients may be submitted to the Board of Trustees
via the CFC at any time.

the announced prizes must be stated.

**AWARDING PRIZES**

**1102.**
Unless other methods are stated in pre-tournament publicity, the director shall abide by
the following guidelines in allocating prizes.

**1103. Cash Prizes**:

a) no winner should receive more than one cash award for which he is eligible.
The award may be one full cash prize (if he is a clear winner) or parts of two or more
cash prizes (if he wins tied with others).
Such special prizes as "upset" or "best game" may be excepted from this rule.

b) a clear winner of more than one cash prize should be awarded the greatest prize.

c) tied winners of place prizes, or tied winners (in the same class) of class prizes,
should be awarded all the cash prizes involved, summed and divided equally,
but no more than one cash prize (in order of amount) should go into the division for each winner.

d) if winners of class prizes tie with winners of place prizes,
all the cash prizes involved should be summed and divided equally among the tied winners,
no more than one cash prize, in order of amount, to go into the division for each winner,
unless the class-prize winners would receive more cash by dividing only the class prizes.

e) an announced class prize must be awarded even if only one player in that class
completes his schedule of play.

**1104. Non-cash (Indivisible) Prizes**:

a) Irrespective of any cash award won, no winner should receive more than one non-cash prize,
the most valuable to which he is entitled.

b) although tie-breaking should be avoided if possible, ties may be broken
to award trophies or merchandise, to determine which player wins any title at stake
or qualifies for another contest, or to serve any other purpose than the award of cash prizes.

c) two players tieing for a championship are considered co-champions;
the tie may be broken if more than two players tie for a championship.
