Thanks in advance for joining the CFC!
A CFC membership not only supports the game and sport of chess in Canada,
it allows you to participate in CFC-rated tournaments.

* **How To Join?**: You need to contact the CFC for instructions:
  <br><a class="button is-primary is-small" href="https://forms.gle/miag39Q6tutM7pmc7">Contact the CFC</a>
  
* **Why?**: We are working on a new system for memberships.
  Unfortunately, before that was completed, the old CFC website
  stopped working.  Viruses and the "store" for puchasing memberships
  just stopped working.
  Until the new system is working, we need to rely on forms and email.
