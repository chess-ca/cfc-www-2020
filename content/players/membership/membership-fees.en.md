+++

The CFC has several membership types.
Fees depend on the province in which the member resides
(not the province in which a tournament is held).

The fees for memberships are different by province
because 1) each province calculates taxes differently
and 2) some provinces have a chess association that receive a portion of the fee.

## Annual Memberships

Most CFC members have Annual memberships.

A "Junior" is anyone who was born after 
December 31, <span v-text="(new Date()).getFullYear() - 21"></span>.

\* Quebec residents with an active FQE membership may play in CFC-rated events
without purchasing a CFC membership.

and 2) who purchases his or her membership at the same time
as the regular Member may join the CFC at a reduced rate.
Only the additional memberships are reduced; not the regular member's fee.

## Single Tournament Fee 

Instead of a CFC membership, players may pay a single tournament fee to play in one CFC-rated tournament and be rated.
The fee is good for one specific tournament only and expires on the last day of the tournament.
The fee depends on the time controls of the tournament: Regular or Quick.
The fee depends on the province in which the player resides (not the province where the tournament is held).
