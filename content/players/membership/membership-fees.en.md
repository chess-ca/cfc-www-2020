The CFC has several membership types.

The fees for memberships are different by province
because 1) each province calculates taxes differently
and 2) some provinces have associations that receive a portion of the fee.

## Ordinary Annual Memberships

Most CFC members have Ordinary Annual memberships.

A "Junior" is defined as anyone whose age was 19 or less on
January 1, <script>document.write(cfc_now_year);</script>.

The CFC at the same time will collect any Provincial Life Member Fees set by the provincial affiliate
for the province in which the member resides.

| 41 to 50 | 540.00 |

## Single Tournament Fee 

Instead of a CFC membership, players may pay a single tournament fee to play in one CFC-rated tournament and be rated.
The fee is good for one specific tournament only and expires on the last day of the tournament.
The fee depends on the time controls of the tournament: Regular or Quick.
The fee depends on the province in which the player resides (not the province where the tournament is held).

A "Junior" is anyone whose age was 19 or less on
January 1, <script>document.write(cfc_now_year);</script>.

60 minutes or more for a game of 60 moves.
