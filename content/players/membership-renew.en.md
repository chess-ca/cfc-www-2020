Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CFC is temporarily changing its
membership renewal policy:

### For memberships that expire on or after March 1, 2020

* Your CFC membership is automatically extended until further notice.
  
* When the CFC has determined that CFC-rated events have returned to a reasonable level,
  automatic extensions will cease.
  After N months of extending (where N is to be determined),
  N months will be added to the expiry date of your CFC membership.
  
* Until then, your CFC membership is valid for all types of CFC-rated tournaments:
  over the board or online.

### For memberships that expire on or before February 29, 2020

* Your CFC membership has expired.
  
* You must renew your CFC membership to play in any type of 
  CFC-rated tournament: over the board or online.

* **How To Renew?**: You need to contact the CFC for instructions:

* **Why?**: We are working on a new system for memberships.
  Unfortunately, before that was completed, the old CFC website
  stopped working.  Viruses and the "store" for puchasing memberships
  just stopped working.
  Until the new system is working, we need to rely on forms and email.
