Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CFC is temporarily changing its
membership renewal policy:

### For annual memberships that expire on or after March 1, 2020

* Your CFC membership is automatically extended until further notice.
  
* Your CFC membership is valid for all types of CFC-rated tournaments:
  over the board, online, etc.

### For annual memberships that expire on or before February 29, 2020

* Your CFC membership has expired.
  
* You must renew your CFC membership to play in any type of 
  CFC-rated tournament: over the board, online, etc.

* **How To Renew?**: You need to contact the CFC for instructions:
  <br><a class="button is-primary is-small" href="https://forms.gle/miag39Q6tutM7pmc7">Contact the CFC</a>
  
* **Why?**: We are working on a new system for memberships.
  Unfortunately, before that was completed, the old CFC website
  stopped working.  Viruses and the "store" for puchasing memberships
  just stopped working.
  Until the new system is working, we need to rely on forms and email.

### For single tournament memberships

* Your CFC membership expired on the last day of that tournament.

* You must renew your CFC membership (annual or another single tournament)
  to play in any type of CFC-rated tournament: over the board, online, etc.
