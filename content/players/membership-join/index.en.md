Thanks in advance for joining the CFC!
A CFC membership not only supports the game and sport of chess in Canada,
it allows you to participate in CFC-rated tournaments.

The CFC uses a system called "_JustGo_" (previously called "_GoMembership_")
to manage CFC memberships.
After joining, you will have an id & password on "_JustGo_" for your CFC membership.

See [CFC membership types and fees](/en/players/membership-fees/).

Parents, you can set up "_JustGo_" for your child and pass it along when she/he is older.

How to join or renew?
Select answers to the following questions to get specific instructions:

## Q & A

<template id="join-is-member">

Since you are or were a CFC member, a "_JustGo_" account has already been created for you.
