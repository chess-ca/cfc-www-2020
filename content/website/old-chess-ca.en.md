Go to the OLD chess.ca website, click:

<a href="https://chess.ca/" class="button is-primary">Go to OLD chess.ca</a>

Things to know before you go:

* Why go? You may need to go to the OLD website if you need something that has
not yet been migrated to the NEW website. The OLD website will remain until all
content has been migrated to the NEW website.  

* Be careful! The OLD chess.ca is blocked for some users because of virsuses that *may*
redirect you to another website that has malware.  If this happens, do not do
anything on the other page (especially do not enter ids, passwords, credit cards, etc).
Close your browser tab immediately.

* How? Getting around the blocking is different for different browsers:

  * Chrome: To get to the OLD chess.ca, you may need to click the "Reload" button,
    the "Details" button, and "visit this unsafe site".
    
  * Firefox: To get to the OLD chess.ca, you may need to click the "See details" button
    and "ignore the risk".
  
  * Microsoft Edge: This browser will not block you. It does not use the
    [Stop Badware](https://www.stopbadware.org/) service that is used by
    Chrome and Firefox. You should go directly to chess.ca.
