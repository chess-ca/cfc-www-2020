We tried to keep the old chess.ca website available at "old.chess.ca"
while we migrated its content.

But when Google found it and its malware, they blocked all websites ending in "chess.ca".
Including the new chess.ca website, which did not have any viruses or malware.

So, unfortunately, the old chess.ca website will be unavailable from now on.
If you have a strong need for info not yet migrated to the new website, 
[Contact the CFC](https://forms.gle/miag39Q6tutM7pmc7).

### History

* **Blocked:**
On July 3, 2020, most browsers started blocking chess.ca because of malware.

* **Repair #1:**
A few suspicious things were found and removed from chess.ca.
We requested a review but, on July 7, we were told we had failed the review.
There were still many malware issues to be found and fixed.

* **Repair #2, #3, #4, ... or Replace:**
After some more work, we eventually realized that amount of skill and work it would
take to fully fix our almost 10 year old website far exceeded the amount of work
to just re-write it. 

* **Decision:**
On July 14, an online meeting was held and the decision was made to replace chess.ca.

* **Launched:**
On July 23, the new chess.ca was launched but with many parts still "under construction".
Ideally, we would have everything ready but having something was better than the nothing
we had with the old blocked website.
The initial launch had the basic framework as well as two essential functions:
(1) list of upcoming tournaments
and (2) lookup of players' latest rating and CFC expiry dates.

* **Migration:**
Over the next few months, the remaining content and functions of the old
website will be migrated to the new chess.ca.

Thanks for your patience!
