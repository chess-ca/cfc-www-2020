(((Link to the old website removed. Google scanned us again, found this link,
and blocked us again because the old website has malware.  You will need to 
enter the URL yourself:  old dot chess dot ca )))

Things to know before you go:

* Why go? You may need to go to the OLD website if you need something that has
not yet been migrated to the NEW website. The OLD website will remain until all
content has been migrated to the NEW website.  

* Be careful! The OLD chess.ca is blocked for some users because of virsuses that *may*
or *may not* redirect you to another website that has malware.  If this happens, do not do
anything on that other website (especially do not enter ids, passwords, credit cards, etc).
Close your browser tab immediately.

* How? Getting around the blocking is different for different browsers:

  * Chrome: To get to the OLD chess.ca, you may need to click the "Reload" button,
    the "Details" button, and "visit this unsafe site".
    
  * Firefox: To get to the OLD chess.ca, you may need to click the "See details" button
    and "ignore the risk".
  
  * Microsoft Edge: This browser will not block you. It does not use the
    [Stop Badware](https://www.stopbadware.org/) service that is used by
    Chrome and Firefox. You should go directly to chess.ca.
