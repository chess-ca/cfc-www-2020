Why "under construction?
Because of viruses and malware, the old website was being blocked by many browsers.
Fixing it was too difficult. So an emergency re-write of the website was started.
Parts will be migrated from old to new based in priority sequence.
The part you requested hasn't been migrated (yet) so is still "under construction".
You can still go to the old chess.ca by clicking

* **Blocked:**
On July 3, 2020, most browsers started blocking chess.ca because of malware.

* **Repair #1:**
A few suspicious things were found and removed from chess.ca.
We requested a review but, on July 7, we were told we had failed the review.
There were still many malware issues to be found and fixed.

* **Repair #2, #3, #4, ... or Replace:**
After some more work, we eventually realized that amount of skill and work it would
take to fully fix our almost 10 year old website exceeded the amount of work
to just re-write it. 

* **Decision:**
On July 14, an online meeting was held and the decision was made to replace chess.ca.

* **Launched:**
On July 23, the new chess.ca was launched but with many parts still "under construction".
Ideally, we would have everything ready but having something was better than the nothing
we had with the old blocked website.
The initial launch had the basic framework as well as two essential functions:
(1) list of upcoming tournaments
and (2) lookup of players' latest rating and CFC expiry dates.

* **Migration:**
Over the next few months, the remaining content and functions of the old
website will be migrated to the new chess.ca.

Thanks for your patience!
